# Bug Tracker
*Link coming soon*

---

## Summary
The Bug Tacker (or issue tracker) is an application for developer project management. You can create projects, issues, and assign them to different people. 

## Features *(to come)*
- **Authentication (using Auth0)**
Users need to be able to log in in order to access their own projects and assign certain things to other authorized users.

- **Projects**
When logged in, users should see a visually pleasing and simple display of all their projects so they can easily navigate to where they want to go. They should be able to create new projects on this page as well. The page should also display the progress of each project shown in an instantly recognizable fashion.

- **Issues**
When a user navigates inside of a project, they should see their issues in a way that is easy for them to wrap their head around. They should know what to do next right away. There should be default categories set up for their issues. Maybe: Ideas, To Do, In Progress, Needs Review, and Complete? 

- **Comments**
Unlike githubs version of the bug tracker, this app should have an easy to way to post and show comments / questions on anything. Most importantly, issues. These comments should be legitimate. They should also be able to be closed or approved. There can be different types of comments. Like questions, ideas, and notes. Questions can be answered, ideas can be voted on, notes can be "seen" or approved.

- **Delete vs Close**
Everything should be able to be removed. This is separate from being closed. Delete erases all records of the item where as closing an item will allow it to still be seen.

- **Closed**
There should be a closed projects page and a closed issues page. They will display all of the closed projects or closed issues that partain to the project.
