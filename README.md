# Bug Tracker
*Link coming soon*

---

## Summary
The Bug Tacker (or issue tracker) is an application for developer project management. You can create projects, issues, and assign them to different people. 

## Features *(to come)*
- **Authentication (using Auth0)**
Users need to be able to log in in order to access their own projects and assign certain things to other authorized users.

- **Projects**
When logged in, users should see a visually pleasing and simple display of all their projects so they can easily navigate to where they want to go. They should be able to create new projects on this page as well. The page should also display the progress of each project shown in an instantly recognizable fashion.

- **Issues**
When a user navigates inside of a project, they should see their issues in a way that is easy for them to wrap their head around. They should know what to do next right away.
