## Summary
The Bug Tacker (or issue tracker) is an application for developer project management. Users can create and manage projects, issues, and comments. Project owners can even add other users to their projects for collaboration. 

## Features

- Simple and secure username and password authentication
- Create projects and share access with other users
- Create issues and track their progress
- Comment on issues for the whole team to communicate

---

### Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- MVC
- Passport.js
- Bootstrap + CSS
- Handlebars
- jQuery
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose

## Future Plans
- Cleaner / more professional UI and instructions
- More Management! Project / user management is currently very limited (due to limited development time). 
- User Assignements. I want issues to be assignable to any user in the project.

## Development
This project was a big one! I, Jordan McCollam, worked on this project in my free time between homework for the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp and work as an Audio Engineer. 

I wanted to build something that would display what I've learned in a practical, applicable, real world way. And ultimately, I want to work in the programming industry. So making a development managing tool doesn't hurt :P.

Some Challenges in the development included authentication, and user collaboration. Truth be told, Vanderbilt does *not* teach you much about how authentication works or how to implement it. So after LOTS of research and many failed experiments, I finally found something that worked for me and actually shocked me with how easy it was to implement! Passport.js! Amen to that. And of course, user collaboration was no easy task. But I simply had to take some extra time to think and wrap my head around all the different pieces and I was able to pull a simple system together.

Though the project could use some more love, overall I'm quite pleased with how it turned out! It was a learning experience for sure.

Thanks for checking it out!
